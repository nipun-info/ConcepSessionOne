        <h3>Origin and History of Elephant and Friends </h3>
        <p>
            Do you know that the elephant is the largest land animal? Yes, it is true. The size of the elephant makes it
            one of the strongest mammals too. Many children's stories have been written around an elephant, and the
            “Elephant and Friends” story in English is one such short story with a great moral lesson for kids.
            However, in this story, what if we tell you that no animals wish to be friends with the elephant? Strange,
            right? To know why the other animals do not want to be the elephant's friend, let's read the “Elephant and
            Friends” full story below.
